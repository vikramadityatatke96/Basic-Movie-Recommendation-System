# Basic-Movie-Recommendation-System

In recent years internet connectivity has evolved significantly making it possible to maintain big cloud storages even for the average consumers. This has led to the adoption of streaming services by the consumers. These days consumers are provided with a plethora of options. This has provoked the need to implement recommendation systems. But for new users recommendation engines cannot function due to the complete lack of user-specific data. Until the user data generated it is possible to provide generic recommendation based on the users around them or based on the current trends. This paper talks about such generic queries which can help the existing recommendation systems to deal with new users. Through this project we have carried out experiments on the MovieLens dataset and discussed the results of data analysis. All of our results can be used to provide customers with initial recommendations. Our results are considerably trustworthy due to the sheer number of users who have provided ratings and tags to thousands of movies released in the past century.
